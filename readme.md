# Plenty of Ingredients - Week 5 Group Project - Epicodus

This web app will allow a user to select from a predetermined list of ingredients they might have on hand to return a list of recipes that include those ingredients. This app helps users think of recipes they may not know they could easily make with what is already in their fridge or pantry. This app will reduce food waste and helps the user to save money by limiting the amount of ingredients they need to purchase. This makes the world a better place.
